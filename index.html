                        <h2>Ski Accident</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>In December 2013, Schumacher's life took a tragic turn when he suffered a severe head injury while skiing in the French Alps. The accident left him in a medically induced coma for several months, and since then, his condition has been kept private by his family. The incident shocked the world, bringing an outpouring of support from fans and the racing community. Schumacher's accident serves as a reminder of the fragility of life, even for someone as seemingly invincible as he once appeared. The seven-time World Champion continues to receive treatment, and his legacy endures as fans and the motorsport community hold him in their thoughts.</p>
